# project_03_group_14
For our project we obtained our dataset from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/christinezinkand/storms) looking at storms within the Atlantic Basin, ie. hurricanes, tropical storms, tropical depression. We had cleaned up the data by removing the unnecssary columns of hurricane/tropical storm diameters and adding a combined dates columns combining the year, month, and day into a single column. Afterwards we had split up and had Eugenio, Lindsey, and Thripura began working on visualizations while Mason worked on creating the SQLite and Hassan work on the website. Once we had each completed our tasks, we began working on combining it into the website on Hassan's Folder. From there we copied our work into his folder as to not lose our previous data. Working off the app.py runs the website.
